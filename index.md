# Welcome to my MathQuantum Mini-Project! :sparkles:
This project explores the use of quantum machine learning to predict rectal cancer outcomes by building a Variational Quantum Classifier trained on clinical and MRI data from ~50 patients. 

## It demonstrates the application of quantum-enhanced models on small-scale, high-impact medical datasets.
