I've always been passionate about STEM, using it to solve real-world problems, and making the field a more inclusive one. 

Through MathQuantum, I've expanded my knowledge on quantum computing fundamentals while gaining hands-on experience with Python coding, building circuits, and exploring real-world applications in machine learning, ethics, and technology. The program’s sessions on quantum error correction, quantum machine learning, and ethical considerations helped me connect quantum theory to broader societal impact, reinforcing my desire to use quantum tools to design fairer financial models and improve treatment outcomes for underserved populations. 

Looking ahead, I hope to bring my MathQuantum-inspired project to life with guidance from the program’s educators. As I apply to universities this fall, I plan to continue exploring the intersection of STEM and social impact, pursuing advanced study in a STEM field, while staying committed to outreach, mentorship, and equity in STEM.

I’d like to sincerely thank Mr. Daniel Serrano for running the MathQuantum program with such enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. His guidance, support, and deep commitment to education made this experience incredibly impactful, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn under his leadership.
